LET SUDO INSULT YOU WHEN YOU ENTER INCORRECT PASSWORD

sudo visudo
/etc/sudoers
Defaults   insults

When you configure the insults parameter, it disables the badpass_message parameter which prints a specific message on the command line (the default message is
“sorry, try again”) in case a user enters a wrong password.

To modify the message, add the badpass_message parameter to the /etc/sudoers file as shown below.


HOW TO RUN ‘SUDO’ COMMAND WITHOUT ENTERING A PASSWORD IN LINUX

This setting is done in the /etc/sudoers file, which drives sudoers to use default security policy plugin for the sudo command; under the user privilege 
specification section.

Important: In the sudeors file, the authenticate parameter which is turned on by default is used for authentication purposes. If it is set, users must 
authenticate themselves via a password (or other means of authentication) before they run commands with sudo.

However, this default value may be overridden using the NOPASSWD (require no password when user invokes sudo command) tag.

The syntax to configure user privileges is as follows:

user_list host_list=effective_user_list tag_list command_list

Where:

user_list – list of users or a user alias that has already been set.
host_list – list of hosts or a host alias on which users can run sudo.
effective_user_list – list of users they must be running as or a run as alias.
tag_list – list of tags such as NOPASSWD.
command_list – list of commands or a command alias to be run by user(s) using sudo.
To allow a user (aaronkilik in the example below) to run all commands using sudo without a password, open the sudoers file:

aaronkilik ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

For the case of a group, use the % character before the group name as follows; this means that all member of the sys group will run all commands using sudo without a password.

%sys ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
To permit a user to run a given command (/bin/kill) using sudo without a password, add the following line:

aaronkilik ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/kill
The line below will enable member of the sys group to run the commands: /bin/kill, /bin/rm using sudo without a password:

%sys ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/kill, /bin/rm
