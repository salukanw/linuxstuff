INSTALL GIT FROM SOURCE

Before you begin, first you need to install required software dependencies from the default repositories, along with the utilities that needed to build a binary
from source:

# yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
# yum install gettext-devel openssl-devel perl-CPAN perl-devel zlib-devel
After you have installed required software dependencies, go to the official Git release page and grab the latest version and compile it from source using 
following series of command:

# wget https://github.com/git/git/archive/v2.10.1.tar.gz -O git.tar.gz
# tar -zxf git.tar.gz
# cd git-2.10.1/
# make configure
# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
# make install
# git --version


SET UP GIT ACCOUNT IN LINUX

In this section, we shall cover how to set up a Git account with correct user information such as name and email address to avoid any commit errors, and the 
git config command is used to do that.

Important: Make sure to replace username with the actual name for the Git user to be created and used on your system.

You can start by creating a Git user with the useradd command as below, where the -m flag used to create the user’s home directory under /home and -s specifies 
the user’s default shell.

# useradd -m -s /bin/bash username 
# passwd username
Now, add the new user to the wheel group to enable the account to use the sudo command:

# usermod username -aG wheel 

Then configure Git with the new user as follows:

# su username 
$ sudo git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ sudo git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
Now verify Git configuration using following command.

$ sudo git config --list 
If there are no errors with the configurations, you should be able to view an output with the following details:

user.name=username
user.email= username@some-domian.com
