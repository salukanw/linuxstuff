Verify connectivity   -  ping -c 4 openstack.org
					     ping -c 4 compute1
						 
From the compute node, test access to the Internet:
	ping -c 4 openstack.org
	
Controller node

yum install chrony
	Edit the /etc/chrony.conf file and add, change, or remove the following keys as necessary for your environment:
	server NTP_SERVER iburst
	
To enable other nodes to connect to the chrony daemon on the controller, add the following key to the /etc/chrony.conf file:
	allow 10.0.0.0/24

systemctl enable chronyd.service
systemctl start chronyd.service

Other nodes

yum install chrony
server controller iburst
systemctl enable chronyd.service
systemctl start chronyd.service

Perform these procedures on all nodes.
Enable the OpenStack repository
yum install centos-release-openstack-mitaka
yum upgrade
Install the OpenStack client:
yum install python-openstackclient
Install the openstack-selinux package to automatically manage security policies for OpenStack services:
yum install openstack-selinux

Controller Node
yum install mariadb mariadb-server python2-PyMySQL
Create and edit the /etc/my.cnf.d/openstack.cnf file and complete the following actions:

In the [mysqld] section, set the bind-address key to the management IP address of the controller node to enable access by other nodes via the management network:

[mysqld]
...
bind-address = 10.0.0.11

In the [mysqld] section, set the following keys to enable useful options and the UTF-8 character set:

[mysqld]
...
default-storage-engine = innodb
innodb_file_per_table
max_connections = 4096
collation-server = utf8_general_ci
character-set-server = utf8

systemctl enable mariadb.service
systemctl start mariadb.service

mysql_secure_installation

NoSQL database

Install the MongoDB packages:
yum install mongodb-server mongodb

Edit the /etc/mongod.conf file and complete the following actions:
Configure the bind_ip key to use the management interface IP address of the controller node.

bind_ip = 10.0.0.11

By default, MongoDB creates several 1 GB journal files in the /var/lib/mongodb/journal directory. If you want to reduce the size of each journal file to 128 MB and limit total journal space consumption to 512 MB, assert the smallfiles key:
smallfiles = true

systemctl enable mongod.service
systemctl start mongod.service

Message queue

yum install rabbitmq-server

systemctl enable rabbitmq-server.service
systemctl start rabbitmq-server.service

Add the openstack user:

rabbitmqctl add_user openstack RABBIT_PASS
Creating user "openstack" ...
...done.

Permit configuration, write, and read access for the openstack user:
rabbitmqctl set_permissions openstack ".*" ".*" ".*"
Setting permissions for user "openstack" in vhost "/" ...
...done.
